# ICONLOTT Lightpaper

A very *simple* yet fun and *incentivized* lottery game on ICON blockchain network.

Unlike other gamble or lottery Dapps, this game utilizes and features 

- Very simple rule, no multiple rounds running simultaneously, only one
- Subsidy funded by ICONVIET in launch phase, which is very attractive and incentivizing early participants
- *Probabilistic pseudorandom selection algorithm* in smart contract environment, which rewards players taking greater risk

In order to play this game, you only need to know one thing : *how to send ICX*, the chance of winning is proportional to the size of ICX deposit.

## Definitions

### Internal variables

`PLAYERS` : a record of players ( mapping between ICX addresses and deposit size )

`JACKPOT` : accumulated amount of ICX deposited to this lottery contract in one single round

`LAST_SETTLEMENT_BH` : the height of block in which previous winner selection procedure was executed

`LAST_WINNER` : address of the winner in previous round

`TOP_DEPOSIT` : highest recorded ICX amount transferred by a single player in current round

### External variables

`DEPOSIT_BH` : the height of block which contains the transaction of ICX deposit to this lottery contract by a certain player

`TX_HASH` : the hash of winner selection transaction

### Governance parameters

`MAX_SUBSIDY`: determine the maximum amount of ICX held in the contract for subsidizing the final prize to reach `POT_LIMIT` for each round. Must not be greater than `POT_LIMIT`

`POT_LIMIT` : the limit of `JACKPOT`, it helps to prevent huge loss in case of contract bug and hack

`COMMISSION` : ICX amount in `JACKPOT` to be tranferred to `PROFIT_HOLDER` after each round, in form of percentage, e.g. *5%*

`PROFIT_HOLDER` : address that hold profit from commission

[[Rule]]
## Rule

1. Players can send their ICX to the contract once per round, sender's addresses are included in `PLAYERS` list of the contract. Here we have `NEW_DEPOSIT` as tranferred ICX amount

- If `JACKPOT` `+` `NEW_DEPOSIT` exceeds `POT_LIMIT`, transaction will fail

2. When `draw_winner` function of the contract is called by some `external_agent` ( contract cannot trigger itself )

- There must be at least 2 players in current round
- The settlement procedure is executed
- The winner is chosen
- `PLAYERS` record and other relevant variables are also reset
- `COMMISSION` percentage of `JACKPOT` is transferred to `PROFIT_HOLDER`, and the rest to the winner. +
For instance, assume `COMMISSION` is *5%*, we have
* *5%* of `JACKPOT` is transferred to `PROFIT_HOLDER`
* *95%* to the prize
- If `MAX_SUBSIDY` is greater than zero and `JACKPOT` still less than `POT_LIMIT`, then
* `FINAL_PRIZE = JACKPOT + MAX_SUBSIDY` 
* If `FINAL_PRIZE` is greater than `POT_LIMIT`, it will be cut down to `POT_LIMIT`

3. If `LAST_SETTLEMENT_BH` and `DEPOSIT_BH` is the same, and if ICX deposit transaction is executed after the winner drawing transaction, that sender will be in `PLAYERS` list of the next round.

4. For each player, the probability of being chosen as winner is proportional to the size of ICX deposit.

5. Winner is chosen by a pseudo-random function with random seed composed of `TX_HASH` `+` `number of PLAYERS` `+` `JACKPOT` ( string concatenation )

[[Fairness]]
## Fairness and transparency

The winner selection procedure is

- Based on pseudo-random function, hence no one is able to manipulate and game the system ( assume there is no bug )
- Contract code is public and can be audited by anyone

[[Roadmap]]
## Roadmap and the role of ICONVIET

### Phase 0

- All governance parameters are set by ICONVIET, including
* `MAX_SUBSIDY` is *1000* ICX, funded by ICONVIET
* `POT_LIMIT` is *2000* ICX per day
* `COMMISSION` is *0%*
- Winner selection is triggered by ICONVIET for approximately each 43200 blocks period ( daily )

This phase will last for at least one month, to keep bugs under control ( if any ), as well as gathering insights for further development.

### Phase 1

To be decided...
